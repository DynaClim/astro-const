# Astro-constants
This crate contains numerical constants useful in astronomy and astrophysics.
The objective is to create a single source of truth for all "astro" related constants, to avoid redefining in each project.
Contributions are very welcome.

# Contributing
Each constant should be up to date according to recent publications and standards, and must include a reference the the source of the constant.

## TODO
A decision on naming convention needs to be made. (e.g. should the units, year or source be included in the constant name?)
This would allow different values for constants to co-exist, and allow for clear distinction between versions of the constant used.
